##  WHO AM I ? 
## 👋 Hi, I'm Rael Madaraka Ogega — but just call me **Madaraka**! 
📍 Based in Nairobi, Kenya

A naturally inquisitive data enthusiast with a passion for personal knowledge management, collecting data, and uncovering insights that could bloom into new ideas. My journey into the world of data began with an inherent love for capturing, organizing, distilling, and expressing information and finding meaningful patterns within it. This fascination drove me to master Excel, SQL, spreadsheets and, Python. I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights to support decision-making. I'm passionate about storytelling with data, solving business problems, and continuously learning new technologies.

When I'm not deep in tech, my life is packed with action, learning, and adventure! I hit the basketball court hard, always pushing myself to be fitter and better – it's a discipline that fuels everything I do. I absolutely love to read and learn, soaking up every book, article, and new idea I can find. This constant drive to understand helps me tackle tough problem problems. And my passion for technology is huge! I'm always upgrading my skills and diving into the newest tech. Why? To bring massive value to my team and stay super relevant in this fast-changing world.

## 📁 Projects

### Farmer-Exporter Linkage System https://github.com/OGEGARAEL/farmer_exporter_linkage_system
**Tech Stack**:html, sql, javascript, php 

Developed and deployed an efficient farmer-exporter linkage system as part of my university research project. The system optimized organizational workflows and enhanced project management capabilities within agricultural value chains.
This project was born out of my firsthand experience as a farmer, aimed at empowering local hass avocado farmers by streamlining access to export markets, reducing exploitation by middlemen, and ultimately improving livelihoods through a more direct, transparent, and community-driven linkage system. It also contributes to food security and country development by promoting fair trade and sustainable farming practices.


###  Furniture Website 
https://github.com/OGEGARAEL/FURNITURE-WEBSITE
**Tech Stack**: html, css, javascript

Developed a furniture website using web development tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a digital platform for furniture sellers and entrepreneurs.
This website solves key challenges faced by furniture businesses, including limited visibility, lack of online presence, and difficulties reaching a wider customer base. By offering an easy-to-navigate, visually appealing online storefront, the platform helped sellers showcase their products, attract new customers, and increase sales without the high costs of a physical showroom.

### 🦠 HIV Data Trend Analysis Using R  
https://github.com/OGEGARAEL/R-intern

Used R to analyze and visualize global HIV trends, focusing on countries contributing to 75% of the global burden. Filtered and grouped data by WHO region, performed data cleaning and transformation, and created insightful visualizations using ggplot2 to show HIV case trends over time. This project supports better understanding of regional disparities in HIV burden and informs targeted public health strategies.
